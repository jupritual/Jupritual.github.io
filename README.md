## ✦ What is Jupritual?

Jupritual is not a template bot. It is a **fully custom Discord bot** built from the ground up using Python and discord.py — every system, every embed, every interaction flow designed and coded by hand.

It combines advanced moderation tooling, server automation, a dynamic role system, and a structured help registry into a single production-ready bot — deployed 24/7 on Oracle Cloud infrastructure.

---

## ✦ Feature Overview

### 🛡️ Moderation Suite
> Complete moderation toolkit with confirmation flows, silent variants, and vote-based actions.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `j.ban` / `j.silentban` | Ban with or without public notice |
| `j.voteban` / `j.votekick` | Democratic moderation — mods vote to take action |
| `j.timeout` / `j.untimeout` | Timed mutes with reason tracking |
| `j.warn` | Warning system with infraction points, decay, and leaderboard |
| `j.purge [filter]` | Filtered message deletion — by user, embeds, bots, and more |

**Every action includes:** confirmation buttons, mod log integration, DM notification toggle, and audit trail.

---

### 🔧 Moderation Tools

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `j.lock` / `j.unlock` | Channel lock using correct `manage_roles` permission overwrite |
| `j.slock` / `j.sunlock` | Silent lock/unlock with reaction confirmation |
| `j.slowmode` | Set channel slowmode |
| `j.locklist` | View all currently locked channels via dropdown |
| `j.nickname` | Manage member nicknames |
| `j.snipe` | Recover recently deleted messages |

---

### 💤 AFK System
> One of the most feature-complete AFK systems available in a self-built bot.

- **Global & Local modes** — AFK across all servers or just the current one
- **Notify & Drop Note** — people who ping you while AFK can drop notes or subscribe to notify
- **Welcome Back summary** — pings received + notes waiting when you return
- **Privacy settings** — control who can see your AFK status
- **AFK leaderboard & stats**

---

### 🎭 Custom Role System
> A full role assignment engine with trigger-based custom embeds.

- Create named **role triggers** mapped to Discord roles
- Fully **customizable assign/remove embeds** per trigger
- **Dynamic placeholders**: `{user.name}`, `{guild.name}`, `{role.mention}`, `{timestamp}`, and more
- **Live embed preview** before saving
- Trigger management panel: edit, delete, rename — all via interactive buttons

---

### 🤖 Automation

- **Auto-Reaction Manager** — rule-based emoji reactions, up to 20 active rules per server
- **Welcome/Leave System** — configurable join/leave embeds + welcome DMs with dynamic placeholders
- **DM Toggle** — admins control whether the bot sends DMs for moderation actions

---

### 📋 Logging System
> Per-action log routing — each moderation action logs to its own configured channel.

- Per-event channel assignment (ban, kick, warn, lock, role changes, etc.)
- Mod logs overview with dropdown navigation
- Activity summary with action counts per moderator
- Auto-deletes logs older than 90 days

---

### 🎮 Roleplay System
> 50+ roleplay commands in two categories.

- **User actions** (34): hug, kiss, slap, pat, poke, wave, and more
- **Solo actions** (16): cry, smile, blush, think, and more

---

### ⚙️ Server Configuration

- **Dynamic prefix** per server — stored in MongoDB, changeable anytime
- **Command toggle system** — enable/disable any command per-channel or server-wide
- **Logging setup** — route any mod action to any channel
- **Welcome system** — fully configurable with 30+ dynamic placeholders

---

### 📖 Help System
> A structured help registry with dropdown navigation across 12 categories.

## ✦ Architecture

```
jupritual/
├── main.py                  # Bot entry point, cog loader, event hooks
├── cogs/
│   ├── moderation.py        # ban, kick, timeout, warn system
│   ├── mod_tools.py         # lock, unlock, slowmode, purge
│   ├── afk.py               # AFK system with global/local mode
│   ├── autoreaction.py      # Auto-reaction rule engine
│   ├── custom_roles.py      # Role trigger + embed system
│   ├── welcome.py           # Join/leave/DM welcome system
│   ├── logging.py           # Per-action mod log routing
│   ├── roleplay.py          # 50+ roleplay commands
│   ├── info.py              # User/server info commands
│   ├── toggles.py           # Command enable/disable system
│   └── help.py              # Structured help registry
├── mongo_prefix.py          # Dynamic per-guild prefix handler
└── utils/
    └── set_logging.py       # Guild config helper
```

**Key technical decisions:**
- `motor` async driver for non-blocking MongoDB operations
- Per-guild config documents — no shared state between servers
- Cog-based architecture — each system is isolated and independently loadable
- Interactive UI built entirely with `discord.ui.View`, `discord.ui.Button`, `discord.ui.Select`

## ✦ About

Built solo by **Divyam** — a Computer Science engineering student — as a long-term project to learn backend systems, Discord API internals, database design, and cloud deployment.

This bot is not a fork. Not a tutorial project. Every system was designed, built, debugged, and deployed independently.
